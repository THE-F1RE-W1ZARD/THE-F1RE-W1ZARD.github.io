      <h2>Our Project</h2>
      <p>Under the guidance of Joseph Slade, a graduate from Oregon State University's School of Psychological Science,
        we implemented a model of OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 Turbo using a mixture of fine-tuning and retrieval augmented
        generation (RAG). The goal of this was to create a model capable of acting as a tutor for psychology freshmen.
        This model was then distributed to students through a Qualtrics survey. This was done as part of a study with the aim of finding how the use of AI impacts the short term memory of students, a question recently posed by educational institutions with the rise of AI-use in classrooms. As a side project, we experimented with
        several different approaches in an attempt to find an AI-based writing grader that could perform as well as a
        human grader.</p>

      <p>The left figure shows there is a statistically significant difference (with 95% confidence) between the groups that had access to the base GPT-4 Turbo and the control group that only had access to the textbook.</p>
      <p>The right figure shows quiz scores density of our different experiment conditions. Out of 18 total points, the control group averaged 9, AI tutor averaged 10.5, and base ChatGPT averaged 11.5.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that the sample size at the time this was done was 157 responses and the target size is 200, thus it may be insufficiently powered.</p>
      <p>It is also important to note subsequent studies will both refine and further dive into the reasoning behind these findings.</p>

          <p>Howdy everyone, I'm Matthew. I study Economics and Computer Science (AI speciality) with a minor in Mathamatics here. 
            For this project, I primarily worked on hosting everything in AWS and the initial work for the AI grader. I also became the informal leader of our capstone team.
            I'm graduating next winter due to a MECOP internship over the summer and fall. Afterwards I plan to take a long needed vacation and then start working.

          <p>Hey, I'm Aaron. I'm majoring in CS with a focus in AI. I'll be graduating this Spring. I worked on the various scraping programs used for training the tutoring and writing grader models, from the open-source textbook (website and XML), Canvas quizzes, and Canvas submission comments. I also worked and experimented with the writing grader programs, such as making the training of the model both time and cost efficient. My <a
