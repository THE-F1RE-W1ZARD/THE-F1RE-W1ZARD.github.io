      <h2>Our Project</h2>
      <p>Under the guidance of Joseph Slade, a graduate from Oregon State University's School of Psychological Science, we implemented a model of OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 Turbo using a mixture of fine-tuning and retrieval augmented generation (RAG). The goal of this was to create a model capable of acting as a tutor for psychology freshmen. This model was then distributed to students through a Qualtrics survey. As a side project, we experimented with several different approaches in an attempt to find a AI-based writing grader that could perform as well as a human grader.</p>
